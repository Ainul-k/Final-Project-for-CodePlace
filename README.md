Waveforms in Motion: SHM in Real-Time

A real-time visualization of Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) waveforms with interactive controls.

(Optional: Add a visual preview)
Features

    Real-time rendering of SHM waveforms (sine, cosine, damped oscillations)

    Adjustable parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase, damping)

    Interactive GUI controls (sliders, buttons)

    Export waveform data as CSV/JSON

    Built with [Python + Matplotlib] / [JavaScript + p5.js] (specify your tech stack)

Installation
Python Version
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/waveforms-in-motion.git
cd waveforms-in-motion
pip install -r requirements.txt  # numpy, matplotlib, etc.

JavaScript Version
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/waveforms-in-motion.git
cd waveforms-in-motion
npm install  # if using p5.js, etc.

Usage

Run the application:

Python
bash

python main.py

(Use sliders to adjust waveform parameters in real-time.)

JavaScript
bash

npm start  # or open index.html in a browser

(Interactive web-based visualization.)
