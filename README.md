# Final-Project-for-CodePlace
Project Description:
This project focuses on simulating and analyzing Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) â€” a fundamental concept in physics describing the oscillatory motion of objects such as pendulums, springs, or vibrating masses. SHM is characterized by a restoring force proportional to displacement, resulting in smooth, repetitive motion over time.
